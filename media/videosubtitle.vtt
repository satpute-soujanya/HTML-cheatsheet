00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:04.500
Improvement pill here a study was
conducted in 2014 at Princeton

2
00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:08.550
University where they separated a class
into two groups the researchers had each

3
00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:12.030
group take notes for a class in two
different ways the first group was told

4
00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:14.969
to take notes by hand
you know the old-school method with a

5
00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:18.990
pen and paper which was met with a lot
of groans and complaints because well it

6
00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:22.109
requires a lot of effort it's
time-consuming and it cramps up your

7
00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:26.279
hands the second group was told to take
notes by typing it out on their laptop

8
00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:30.449
or phone or whatever device which was a
far more efficient way of note-taking in

9
00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:34.710
fact the second group on average ended
up with twice the amount of notes after

10
00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:38.489
each class compared with the pen and
paper group now the purpose of this

11
00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:42.239
study was to figure out what method of
taking notes would allow you to remember

12
00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:45.960
more of what was being taught so at the
end of the semester the researchers

13
00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:49.649
looked at the overall test scores for
all of the students in this class and to

14
00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:53.670
their surprise the kids who took notes
by hand using the old-school pen and

15
00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:58.440
paper method scored twice as well as the
kids who used their laptops that's a lot

16
00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:02.340
and at first the researchers thought
okay maybe having this group take notes

17
00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:07.170
by hand somehow prompted them to study a
bit more outside of class so they

18
00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:11.130
conducted this study two more times one
time they tested each group immediately

19
00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:15.720
after class so they had no time to study
and the second time they gave a surprise

20
00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:20.189
test to each group only a week after
they took notes and both times the kids

21
00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:23.640
who took notes by hand
squirt about twice as well as the kids

22
00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:27.420
who typed out their notes what they
discovered in this experiment is what I

23
00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:31.259
like to call the effort principle
essentially the more effort you put into

24
00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:34.799
recording a piece of information the
better you will retain it and I believe

25
00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:37.890
that this is a concept has a lot of
value in the world of self improvement

26
00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:41.549
see one of the biggest issues with self
improvement is the fact that there's so

27
00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:45.270
much information out there there are
hundreds of thousands of books videos

28
00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:48.930
and podcasts but it doesn't matter how
much time you spend consuming this

29
00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:53.430
information because if you're not
remembering any of it and internalizing

30
00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:57.990
the lessons there's no point now I know
I know I'm someone who advocates

31
00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:01.770
listening to audiobooks a lot I tell you
guys to do it all the time but to be

32
00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:06.899
honest I don't think just listening to
audiobooks is ideal it's too easy it

33
00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:10.770
doesn't require that much effort in fact
back in the day I would often find

34
00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:13.740
myself listening to an entire book and
just one or two week

35
00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:17.640
later barely remembering any of the key
concepts so today I want to show you a

36
00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:21.390
sort of note-taking mini habit that I
created over the years that has allowed

37
00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:25.080
me to retain most of the key lessons
from the books that I listen to quick

38
00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:28.440
little side tangent if you are
interested in building habits we do have

39
00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:32.070
a new program the habit builder
challenge that teaches you exactly how

40
00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:35.640
to do that we sold out all of the seats
in just a week and the program has been

41
00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:39.090
extremely successful so far so if you
want to gain access to this program the

42
00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:41.880
next time we run it all you have to do
is click on the link in the description

43
00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:45.600
box below to sign up for the waiting
list now back to the topic at hand the

44
00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:49.740
note-taking mini habit is essentially
this see I carried these little water

45
00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:52.890
proof notebooks with me they are a bit
smaller than my phone which makes them

46
00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:55.860
very easy to carry around and whenever
I'm listening to a book and I come

47
00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:59.700
across in a ha moment basically a moment
where the gears in your head click and

48
00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:03.510
something just makes a whole lot of
sense to you something that you know is

49
00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:07.110
a game changer that you should really
remember when that happens I will put in

50
00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:10.890
some effort to record that lesson down
for example a couple of weeks ago I was

51
00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:14.490
listening to can't hurt me by David
Goggins at the gym and I came across in

52
00:03:14.490 --> 00:03:18.330
a ha moment when he talked about what he
likes to call the cookie jar method the

53
00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:21.660
moment I heard about this method I
thought to myself wow this is some

54
00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:25.650
powerful stuff I need to remember this
so I put down my weights I paused the

55
00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:29.490
audio book I pulled out my little
notebook and pen and I wrote down cookie

56
00:03:29.490 --> 00:03:33.570
jar method and I proceeded to write a
short little summary about what it was

57
00:03:33.570 --> 00:03:37.290
and after doing that I rewinded the
audio by a couple of minutes just so I

58
00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:40.440
could listen to that part again if you
take a look at this incident I'm putting

59
00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:44.400
in maybe 10 20 times more effort into
digesting this one piece of information

60
00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:49.590
as compared to if I just listen to it on
the audiobook and because of that that

61
00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:53.700
lesson has stuck with me ever since and
to top it all off when I really really

62
00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:56.880
want a lesson to stick with me I'll
actually go out of my way and put in

63
00:03:56.880 --> 00:04:01.050
even more effort by bringing it up in a
conversation soon after I have some

64
00:04:01.050 --> 00:04:03.450
friends that are interested in
self-improvement and when we're just

65
00:04:03.450 --> 00:04:06.600
hanging out I'll talk about some of the
new concepts I've come across recently

66
00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:10.320
the moment you reach what you've learned
you're putting in additional effort

67
00:04:10.320 --> 00:04:13.980
which will cause you to retain the
information even more this episode's

68
00:04:13.980 --> 00:04:17.910
brought to you by you guessed it audible
now that you know about the effort

69
00:04:17.910 --> 00:04:21.269
principle you still have to read books
and orders to find powerful lessons that

70
00:04:21.269 --> 00:04:25.169
are even worth remembering this is where
audible comes in audible allows you to

71
00:04:25.169 --> 00:04:27.410
find powerful lessons in places where
you normally

72
00:04:27.410 --> 00:04:30.440
be able to pull out a physical book I
listen to the audio books when I'm

73
00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:33.410
commuting on long flights when I'm
eating by myself and when I'm working

74
00:04:33.410 --> 00:04:52.100
out go to www.youtube.com packed with
powerful lessons that we should all

75
00:04:52.100 --> 00:04:57.760
remember so definitely check that out
besides that guys stay tuned
